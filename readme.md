### About

I was looking at the Steam summer sale today (2.7.19), because i watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teARLSdxdL0) about an "exploit" in this years sale.

After watching the video, I thought to myself. Damn, I can actually automate this stuff. And that is what I did on my second day of holiday. Feel free to use it for your purpose.

### The Exploit

The Exploit is essentially just an easy way of getting points in this years sale, but your account can be limited, if you didn't bought a lot of games lately.

You can boost your accounts levels or get 5â‚¬ steam gift cards.

Depending on your purchases this processes can take up to days or just an hour.

### Why Isaac

My randomly created character, for tetsing purposes, is named Isaac.
And Isaac sounds better than `sss2019x`.
